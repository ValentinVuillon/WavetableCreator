To create a wavetable:

-create a function. You can use the function already available and the already available operators. You can create new functions and new operators. The possibilities are endless
-line 171, chance the name function to match your function name
-while designing your wavetable, make sure to have prototyping=1 so it saves computer ressources, does not generate the wave file, and displays the wavetable
-when you are happy with your wavetable, switch prototyping to 0. It will generate the wave file
-make sure line 162 to have  sample_number=2048 if you use serum or 1024 if you use ableton wavetable

-to import the wavetable in Serum: go in the wavetable editor and write 2048 in the formula parser. Then drag and drop the wav file in Serum.
-to import the wavetable in Ableton Wavetable: Click on the "raw" button. Then drag and drop the wav file in Ableton Wavetable.
